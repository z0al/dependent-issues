# Dependent Issues

> A GitHub Action for marking issues as dependent on another

It works with PRs and issues and supports cross-repository dependencies.

## Usage

Create `.github/workflows/dependent-issues.yml` with the following content:

```yaml
name: Dependent Issues

on:
  issues:
    types:
      - opened
      - edited
      - reopened
  pull_request_target:
    types:
      - opened
      - edited
      - reopened
      # Makes sure we always add status check for PRs. Useful only if
      # this action is required to pass before merging. Can be removed
      # otherwise.
      - synchronize

  # Schedule a daily check. Useful if you reference cross-repository
  # issues or pull requests. Can be removed otherwise.
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * *'

jobs:
  check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: z0al/dependent-issues@v1
        env:
          # (Required) The token to use to make API calls to GitHub.
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          # (Optional) The token to use to make API calls to GitHub for remote repos.
          GITHUB_READ_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_READ_TOKEN }}
        with:
          # (Optional) The label to use to mark dependent issues
          label: dependent

          # (Optional) Enable checking for dependencies in issues.
          # Enable by setting the value to "on". Default "off"
          check_issues: off

          # (Optional) Ignore dependabot PRs.
          # Enable by setting the value to "on". Default "off"
          ignore_dependabot: off

          # (Optional) A comma-separated list of keywords. Default
          # "depends on, blocked by"
          keywords: depends on, blocked by
```

Here how it can look like in practice:

## Changelog

- **March 20, 2021:** To avoid unnecessary failure due to [insufficient permissions][dependabot-change] on Dependabot PRs, all Dependabot issues and pull requests are now ignored. This behavior is not configurable.
